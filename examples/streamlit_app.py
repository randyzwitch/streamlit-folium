"streamlit-folium integrates two great open-source projects in the Python ecosystem: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) and [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)!"

"""
Currently, there are two functions defined:

- `st_folium()`: a bi-directional Component, taking a Folium/Branca object and plotting to the Streamlit app. Upon mount/interaction with the Streamlit app, st_folium() returns a Dict with selected information including the bounding box and items clicked on

- `folium_static()`: takes a folium.Map, folium.Figure, or branca.element.Figure object and displays it in a Streamlit app.
"""

"""
On its own, Folium is limited to _display-only_ visualizations; the Folium API generates the proper [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) specification,
as HTML and displays it. Some interactivity is provided (depending on how the Folium API is utilized), but the biggest drawback
is that the interactivity from the visualization isn't passed back to Python, and as such, you can't make full use of the functionality
provided by the leaflet.js library.

`streamlit-folium` builds upon the convenient [Folium API](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/modules.html)
for building geospatial visualizations by adding a _bi-directional_ data transfer functionality. This not only allows for increased interactivity between
the web browser and Python, but also the use of larger datasets through intelligent querying.

    But behind the scenes, a lot more is happening _by default_. The return value of `st_folium` is set to
    `st_data`, and within this Python variable is information about what is being displayed on the screen:

    As the user interacts with the data visualization, the values for `bounds` are constantly updating, along
    with `zoom`. With these values available in Python, we can now limit queries based on bounding box, change
    the marker size based on the `zoom` value and much more!
